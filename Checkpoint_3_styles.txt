Differences between relative and absolute positioning
<!-- Relative positions an element relative to its normal position and depends on the flow of other element, if an element is placed within a parent element. Whereas Absolute lets you place  an element anywhere relative to nearest positioned ancestor. it wonâ€™t affect or be affected by any other element in the flow -->

box-sizing: border-box VS default box-sizing

<!-- box-sizing: border-box lets u add borders or paddings to an element without changing the height and width of an element. Default box-sizing will let you add paddings and borders but it will also increase an element's height and width. -->
